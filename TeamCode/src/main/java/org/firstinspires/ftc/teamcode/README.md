### here are some of the most important classes in this code

[Bot](Subsystems/Bot.java)
Holds all imports and objects used to import methods. Basically, when you are making a
new opmode, instead of creating a new instance of each object you need, simply create
an instance of this and

[MecanumDrive](pathing/roadrunner/drives/MecanumDrive.java)
the mecanum drive code, implements roadrunner

[TeleOpActionScheduler](OpmodeActionSceduling/TeleOpActionScheduler.java)
Adds action supports for non autonomous

[TeleOpAction](OpmodeActionSceduling/TeleOpAction.java)
Used by teleop action scheduler, hotels information

[MotorEx](com/arcrobotics/ftclib/hardware/motors/MotorEx.java)

[PinpointLocalizer](pathing/roadrunner/localizers/PinpointLocalizer.java)
a class that roadrunnerifies the pinpoint
Headless Drive Command:
Takes mecanum drive as a constructor input, headless drive code

Action compatible servo class(probably unneccesary in most cases but idk)

CRServo:
continuous rotation servo

Servo:
servo class provided by sdk

REMOVE EXTENDS SUBSYSTEM BASE

DELETE REGULAR DRIVE

Motor:
